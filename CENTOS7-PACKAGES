The centos7 packages required to build Spin and Modex are:
	unzip flex byacc bison gcc glibc-headers make tk
(strictly speaking 'tk' is for running the 'ispin' GUI)

To run the jspin GUI:
	java-1.8.0-openjdk
(On more recent systems, try 'java-openjdk')

Install the equivalent packages for your system. Try brew if you're on MacOS.
